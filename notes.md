# s&p constituents:

# data aggregation problem:
options data is quite complex an requires normalization efforts. The plan is to figure aggreagation and normalization procedures using the sample data that was loaded.

# Two things:
 I passed FRM1, so I took two days off not solving FRM2 problems or coding this project.
 I realized there was no date in the table, so I didn't know which date any option chain belonged to. Fixed that.
